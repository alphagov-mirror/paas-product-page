			<h1 class="heading-large">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h1>
			<p class="summary">Last update: 06 March 2019</p>

			<p>GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud hosting platform for government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations" data-click-events data-click-category="Content" data-click-action="External link clicked">departments, agencies and crown bodies</a>. Our users (‘tenants’) access the platform to deploy and run their services in the cloud. These services are then used by the general public (‘end users’). In order to make GOV.UK PaaS secure and available we need to collect, process and store personal data both from tenants and end users.
			   The data we collect from tenants is different from the data we collect from end users, so this document lists them separately.</p>
			<p>GOV.UK PaaS is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.</p>
			<p>The Cabinet Office is the data controller for the account information of staff of tenant organisations. The tenant organisation will be the data controller for any data that they collect and you should look at the Privacy Notice provided by the relevant site to understand how they use your personal data. The Cabinet Office acts as a data processor for personal data processed by tenants.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">What data we collect from tenants</h2>
			<p>The personal data we collect from you as a tenant will include:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>your name</li>
				<li>your email address</li>
				<li>your mobile telephone number</li>
				<li>your organisational role</li>
				<li>your IP address</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We need this information to provide a service that is in the public interest, as some of the apps we host on GOV.UK PaaS are used by the public to access government services.</p>

			<h3 class="heading-small">Why we need data from tenants</h3>
			<p>We use this information to:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>create and manage user accounts on GOV.UK PaaS</li>
				<li>identify you while you use it </li>
				<li>keep the platform secure from unauthorised access</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="heading-small">What we do with tenants’ data</h3>
			<p>We store the data you provide to:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">

			<p>We will not:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>

			</ul>
			<p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>


			<h3 class="heading-small">How long we keep data from tenants</h3>
			<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>the law requires us to</li>
				<li>we need to provide this service </li>
			</ul>
			<p>In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 2 years.</p>
			<p>We will delete your personal data when you ask us to remove your user account. It might take up to 35 days for your data to be completely cleared from our logs and back-ups.</p>

			<p>The personal data we collect from end users will include:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>their IP address</li>
				<li>any cookies that are set by your service</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We need this information to provide a service that is in the public interest, as some of the apps we host on GOV.UK PaaS are used by the public to access government services. </p>

			<h3 class="heading-small">Why we need your end users’ data</h3>
			<p>We need this information to make sure the platform can meet the demand created by end users who access the services hosted on it.</p>

			<h3 class="heading-small">What we do with your end users’ data</h3>

			<ul class="list list-bullet">

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>
			<p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>
			<p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" data-click-events data-click-category="Content" data-click-action="External link clicked">European Economic Area (EEA)</a> while being processed by GOV.UK PaaS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the EEA through model contract clauses and Privacy Shield.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>
			<p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for GDS are required to keep that data secure.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Children’s privacy protection</h2>
			<p>Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children who are 13 years or younger. We do not intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>
