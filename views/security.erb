			<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Security</h1>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Our safety measures</h2>
			<p>The platform is designed to meet both the <a href="/cloud-security-principles">Cloud Security Principles</a> and the common security needs of data classified as ‘official’:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>data in transit is protected by HTTPS from the client to the platform</li>
				<li>apps communicate with each other through private LANs using <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk">Silk</a>. Silk uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348">VXLAN</a> to address private virtual network address spaces. Cloud Foundry network policies use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables">iptables</a> to stop unwanted communication between apps.</li>
				<li>connections from your application to backing services require TLS</li>
				<li>we host on Amazon Web Services (AWS) - their physical security procedures are <a href="http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CESG_UK_Cloud_Security_Principles.pdf">robust and audited</a></li>
				<li>data in backing services can be encrypted at rest</li>
				<li>separation between users of the platform is enforced by Cloud Foundry’s internal authentication and access control system</li>
				<li>Linux containers provide the boundary between running application instances</li>
				<li>the platform relies on robust operational security and processes (see below)</li>
				<li>it’s possible to change and revoke your team members’ permissions and roles to manage the service</li>
				<li>users can authenticate via single sign-on with your organisation's Google and Microsoft accounts</li>
				<li>we use 2-factor authentication, short-lived credentials and IP restriction policies for identity and access management to protect AWS resources</li>
				<li>shared credentials are rotated to minimise risk of unauthorised access</li>
				<li>Amazon Cloudtrail audits and monitors AWS activity</li>
				<li>the CloudFoundry events API provides audit information about the use of your service</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">How we manage change, vulnerabilities and incidents</h2>
			<p>The platform is built and maintained by a government team within the Government Digital Service, and these are the established working practices:</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>everyone with production access has Security Check (SC) clearance</li>
				<li>code changes are approved by team members who haven’t worked on the feature</li>
				<li>we do pair programming whenever possible</li>
				<li>system configuration and access privileges are under source code control
					and so is documentation</li>
				<li>control changes to the production platform are overseen by civil servants</li>
				<li>we code in the open and our code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov">alphagov</a> project on GitHub - search for the ‘paas’ repositories</li>
				<li>we have a tried and tested incident management approach</li>
				<li>reports of incidents are published and available on our <a href="https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/history">status page</a></li>
				<li>external penetration tests (IT Health Checks) of the platform are carried out annually and it’s our policy to address all issues discovered with a CVSS score of medium or above</li>
				<li>when security updates become available, we start working on them within one working day, prioritising fixes to critical severity vulnerabilities</li>
			</ul>
