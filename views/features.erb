				<li>You can decide to move to other Cloud Foundry-based PaaS providers, including on GCloud, as you’re not locked into our platform</li>
				<li>It's best suited for <a href="https://12factor.net/">Twelve-Factor</a> App development</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Security</h2>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>It’s accredited for handling personal and confidential information classified as Official</li>
				<li>Modern TLS standards are enforced for all traffic entering the platform</li>
				<li>Traffic inside the platform is protected by industry standard, strong IPsec encryption</li>

				<li>Applications can communicate internally via a private network</li>
				<li>Authorised developers have SSH access to application containers to debug problems</li>
